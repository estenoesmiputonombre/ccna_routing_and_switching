# EIA/TIA-568-B

We have 4 pairs of wires

We put the Ethernet with the blank part to the top (Without anything on the surface). Therefore we have the first wire called 1, and so on from up to the bottom.

* 1 -> Transmits +

* 2 -> Transmits -

* 3 -> Receive +

* 6 -> Receive -

* 4-5 and 7-8 -> They are connected and used in __Gigabit Ethernet__

## Pins 568-B vs Pins 568-A

### EIA/TIA-568-B

| Pin | Color of wire |
| --- | ------------- |
| 1 | White/Orange |
| 2 | Orange |
| 3 | White/green |
| 4 | Blue |
| 5 | White/Blue |
| 6 | Green |
| 7 | White/Brown |
| 8 | Brown |

### EIA/TiA-568-A

| Pin | Color of wire |
| --- | ------------- |
| 1 | White/Green |
| 2 | Green |
| 3 | White/Orange |
| 4 | Blue |
| 5 | White/Blue |
| 6 | Orange |
| 7 | White/Brown |
| 8 | Brown |

When we create a __Cross Over Calbe__, we have to use the 568-B at one end of the cable and on the other the 568-A
