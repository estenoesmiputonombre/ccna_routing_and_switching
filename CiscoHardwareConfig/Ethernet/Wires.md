# Wires

* Twisted-Pair cabling

* Coaxial cabling

* Serial cabling -> when connecting an RS-232 of a PC to the console port(or serial port) of a router to config it

* Proprietary cabling -> Data centers to move traffic from one point to the other.

## Twisted-Pair cabling Categories

* Category 1 -> 

    + __Doorbell__ or __voice-grade copper__

    + It is a grade of unshielded twisted pair cabling designed for __telephone communications__.

    + Maximun frequency is __1MHz__

    + It was used in the __Apple Macintosh__ in the late of 1980s

    + It is not official, at least __EIA/TIA(Electronic Industries Alliance and the newer Telecomunications Industry Asociation)__ doesnt consider it.

    + they are only wires without an specific order.

* Category 2 -> __Token Ring__

* Category 3 -> __Telephone/10Mbps Ethernet__

* Category 4 -> __Toke Ring__

* Category 5 -> __100Mb Ethernet__

* Category 5e -> __Gigabit Ethernet__

* Category 6 -> __Gigabit Ethernet__. It is the same than a Twisted-pair but it has a __plastic__ that separates the wires (it is in de middle of each pair of wires) to increment performance

We twist the wires to reduce or eliminate the __cross talk__

We have __Unshielded Twisted-Pair (UTP)__ or __Shielded Twisted-Pair (STP)__

We use the Shielded Twisted-Pair when there are a lot of noise (EMI or RFI)

__EMI__ is __Electromagnetic Interference__
__RFI__ is __Radio-Frequency Interference__

## Coaxial cable

* Cable TV / Cable internet

    + We use the __RG-6__ cabling

    + __F-type__ connector

* Antenna connections (we will see this in wireless access points for the antennas that connect to WAP)

    + __LMR-200__

    + __LMR-400__

    + __LMR-900__

    + Many connector options

## Serial Cabling

* __V.35__ cables

    + Several connector types.

* __DS1__ cable

    + Twisted pair cable

    + RJ-45
