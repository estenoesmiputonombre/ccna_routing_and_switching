# Hardware

There are two basic group of Ethernet hardware components:

* __Signaling components__ - used to send and receive signals over the physical medium.

* __Media components__ - used to build the physical medium that carries the Ethernet signals.

## Signaling components

The signaling components for a __twisted-pair__ system include:

* The __Ethernet interface__ located in the __computer__.

* A __transceiver__.

* Single __twisted-pair__ cable.

## Media components

Cables and signaling components used to create the __signal-carrying__ portion of an Ethernet channel.

For instance, a twisted-pair cabling system uses different components than a fiber optic cabling system.

The design and operation of Ethernet requires that there is only one transmission path between any two stations. An Ethernet grows by extending branches in a network topology called a __tree structure__

## Nomenclature

* Transceiver - It is a combination of __trans-mitter__ and __re-ceiver__
